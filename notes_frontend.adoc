# Frontend

## Mvp screens
- macroplan view (editor mode, view mode)
- weekly plan (editor mode, view mode)
- weekly overview of tracked acitivity
- weekly overview of upcoming planned activities
- single endurance activity form
- data export screen

## Problems
- display multiple metrics in a single macroplan view (could go 3d or a simple toggle)

- export format for data? What are the standards?
       Standards: TCX, FIT, GPX
       Use Sdks from product if needed



- How do i best get/fetch fine granularity location data?
get (aggregate) Use: dead reckoning, maybe kalman filters 
fetch Use: permissions for fine grained gps data


## library choices
- What map provider should I use? (Google, open street map (is that even an option?))

## Activity Considerations
- how to associate user input data with fitness tracker data like Heartrate
- How to enable ability to track a single activity and enrich at the end with userinput
- how to enable ability to track a session after the fact ( user input first, then add fitness tracker data)
- merge data from different data sources (eg: mobile and tracker) ?


## fitness tracker access

### trackers without direct BLE connection
- fitbit


### trackers with BLE connection and open standard
- polar
- garmin
